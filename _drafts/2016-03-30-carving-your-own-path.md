> "When something is important enough, you do it even if the odds are not in your favor." - Elon Musk

* Struggle
* Passion
* Hard work
* Focus
* Goals
* Failure
* Success

These are few words that comes to my mind when I look back past
four years of my life. It has been an amazing journey so far and I'm sure it will continue to be.

As you can see I've been very irregular when it comes to writing something on this blog. What motivates me to
write today? Do you see that Elon Musk quote above? Yes, this is an important post. Well, at least for me. I would consider this
post as a note to my future self.

In last four years, I've had pleasure to work and interact with some of the most inspiring minds. These are the people who helped me find
answers of most critical questions one faces and struggles with to find answers during their whole life. During this tenure, I became part of great
communities like HeadStart, Fossasia and GBG Ahmedabad. I joined and organized Meetups. I've interacted with so many passionate minds working tirelessly
to make their dream come true.

Okay, now you must be thinking how's that related to title of this blog post? This is totally relevant. Let's see how.

People are awesome.

Being part of various communities has given me opportunities to interact with people in divers domain, from tea vendors to CEOs of multi national firms,
designers, writers, artists, budding entrepreneurs, successful entrepreneurs, student and specially those who failed but never gave up.
I've always enjoyed talking to them. Each one of these brings different perspective to life. There are different factors
 which motivates them to do something, to keep looking for and create opportunities.
