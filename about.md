#Hello world!

I, Nikunj Thakkar, am a post-graduate in Information and Technology from [Dhirubhai Ambani Institute of Communication and Technology (DAIICT).](http://www.daiict.ac.in) I am currently working as a Programmer Analyst at [Ishi Systems, Inc.](http://ishisystems.com/)  

So far I got opportunity to do projects in Java, PHP, ASP.NET, Python + Django. I have also developed my interest in front-end and I have used HTML5, CSS3, Bootstrap, JQuery, AngularJS in my projects.


I am also curious about big data, Machine Learning and Natural Language Processing. 

I am also interested in working with people to spread the knowledge and build communities to help and improve the society. Currently I am associated with 
[The Ahmedabad Java Meetup group](http://www.meetup.com/Ahmedabad-Java-Meetup-Group/) as a co-organizer and [GBG Ahmedabad](http://gbgahmedabad.org/) as a core-team member.

Feel free to connect with me. Let's build better software together. :) :)
