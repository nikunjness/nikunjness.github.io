Hello all, Today I'm so excited to introduce Google Code-in, a program from Google to make pre-university students aware with open source software development.

##What is Google Code-in?
Google Code-in is an initiative from Google to provide a platform to pre-university students to understand open source software development through small contributions.
These contributions could be in form of programming, designing, documentation, outreach, research and quality assurance. More details of the program can be found [here](https://codein.withgoogle.com/about/)

##Who can participate?
Pre-university students (ages 13-17) will be able to participate in this program. The program will run between December 7, 2015 to January 25, 2016.

##Additional information and getting started guide
As all the details are well documented on contest site itself, I'm only providing quick references below. Feel free to reach out to me if you have any further queries.

##Fossasia and Google Code-in
Fossasia is an asia-wide community of open source contributors and one of the participating organization in Google Code-in program. Being top ranked organization in last year's GCI program, we look forward to even better participation from the community this year. 
I'm happy to be associated as a mentor with Fossasia this year. We are currently working on preparing task list for students participating this year.

##How can you help?
Open source software plays a major role in our day to day life. Android, Linux and Wikipedia are just few names to get you inspired. We need your help in spreading words about this program. Participation in this program will not only help students to understand how open source software development works, It will give them an opportunity to showcase their ability and skills globally.
Additionally eligible students can earn prizes (digital certificates, t-shirts, hoodies) and grand prize winners will receive a trip to Googleâ€™s headquarters in Mountain View, California for themselves and a parent or legal guardian for 4 nights in June 2016.
