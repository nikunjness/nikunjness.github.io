Hello world!

I'm feeling extremely delighted to unveil **“DataOne – The Company and The Platform”**. 

Background
----
This is about the journey that I've started few months back after leaving my job and today I'm
presenting it to the world as **“DataOne”**. For those who're here for the first time, [my previous blog
post](http://nikunjthakkar.com/thoughts/2016/04/20/carving-your-own-path.html) will give you
some idea on what I'm talking about and you can continue reading this.

Everything Data
----
Few research papers on NoSQL and Big Data caught my attention during studies and I tried to
understand related concepts, luckily while this was going on I got selected for Google Summer of
Code in 2013 to work with Vienna University, Austria to implement NoSQL solution for their
building monitoring system. I wasn't aware that it will not only be one of the most amazing experience
that I'll brag about like this through out my life but it will also drive my career towards amazing
things that I'm enjoying working with today.

Yes, **“DataOne”** is all about working with data. We've built a platform to deliver valuable
business insights out of your data and we'll be adding tonnes of new features. Let's look at some of the interesting facts about Big Data
industry.

1. According to the 2015 IDG Enterprise Big Data Research study, businesses will spend an average of $7.4 million on data-related initiatives in 2016.
2. According to McKinsey, a retailer using Big Data to its fullest potential could increase its
operating margin by more than 60%.
3. Bad data or poor quality data costs organizations as much as 10-20% of their revenue.
4. A 10% increase in data accessibility by a Fortune 1000 company would give that company
approximately $65 million more in annual net income.
5. Big Data will drive $48.6 billion in annual spending by 2019.
6. Data production will be 44 times greater in 2020 than it was in 2009. Individuals create
more than 70% of the digital universe. But enterprises are responsible for storing and
managing 80% of it.
7. It is estimated that Walmart collects more than 2.5 petabytes of data every hour from its
customer transactions. A petabyte is one quadrillion bytes, or the equivalent of about 20
million filing cabinets’ worth of text.
8. By 2020 one third of all data will be stored, or will have passed through the cloud, and wewill have created 35 zetabytes worth of data.
9. A 2015 report by Cap Gemini found that 56% of companies expect to increase their
spending on big data in the next three years.
10. There will be a shortage of talent necessary for organizations to take advantage of Big Data.
By 2018, the United States alone could face a shortage of 140,000 to 190,000 skilled
workers with deep analytical skills as well as 1.5 million managers and analysts with the
know-how to use Big Data analytics to make effective decisions.

Where We Stand?
----
The idea behind DataOne is to build a powerful platform which can not only provide analytics and
shiny dashboards but actual value to the businesses. It's very important for us to understand businesses and how we can increase their revenues by even a small number such as 1%. To tackle
this challenge, we've started working with organizations by consulting them on how they can
leverage benefit out of their data, serve their customers better and increase their revenues. Does this
sound interesting to you? Let's have a meeting and see if we can do the same for you.

Industries and Use Cases
------------------------
Data Analytics is very vast field and can be applied on various use cases across the domains. Our
focus is on driving more business for businesses. We find our platform to be relevant across a wide spectrum of industries. We are working on a model where we work with industry specific domain experts to understand
businesses and apply our knowledge to build solutions which delights customers. Following are
some of the immediate use cases that we're considering at the moment.

+ **Big Data for Social Media Analytics:** Data Analytics can be applied for various use cases in
this domain. It can be used to enable micro-market campaign management to send out
personalized messages to local audience. Optimizing promotions by understanding demands
and sentiments of your audience thus reducing promotion cost. It can also be used to
facilitate real time demand forecasting.

+ **Big Data for Retail/Sales:** By combining big data with IoT, retail stores can provide
extraordinary customer experience by delivering real time offers and product details on
customer devices when they're visiting their store.

+ **Big Data for Logistics and Location Based Services:** Though Logistics plays a major role
in any economy's growth factor, it's often remains unnoticed when it comes to technology
advancement. By enabling big data powered logistics solutions, these services can be
improved and efficiency can be increased marginally.

+ **Big Data for Open Data and Social Good:** Recently various Governments including
Government of India have started their open data initiatives and more Governments will be
following their steps. We're also looking at some the interesting use cases that can solve day
to day life challenges such as public transport (daily commute, vehicle parking efficiency,
traffic situation etc.), water supply, waste management and others.
