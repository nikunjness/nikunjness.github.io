As I promised in my earlier blog post to share my GSoC proposal, you can see the proposal below.

Few points to note about writing proposal :

* Write only relevant information
* Describe your solution precisely and in brief 
* Express your self. Show your positive points.
* If you are using any other resources mention them

That is all. Best luck if you are planning to apply for next GSoC. :)
